Welcome to my first blog post! I'm excited to share my journey from someone with a background in computational physics and general programming to diving headfirst into the world of game development.

## Introduction

My name is Matthew Holden and at the time of writing this, I am a Software Engineer by trade but a hobbyist by night. I love software development, but in general my passion ranges all across technology and doesn't land on technology. I have a passion for the big picture and designing beautiful things in technology so I find myself doing many different hobbies to satiate that desire.

## The Hobbies

My wife tells me that I am "a fixater". Meaning that I tend to find great passion for a specific skill or profession for a short period time and I dive in with everything in me for a short period until I burn out. My fixations tend to follow the pattern laid out below:

[[INSERT FIXATION PATTERN]]

Fixating like this has turned me into someone who is a jack-of-all-trades and a master of none (outside of my career). I find myself excelling at each hobby for a short period of time and gaining enough skill to become "above average" before I call it quits. As you can imagine, this leaves a trail of tears behind me in the form of unfinished projects, half-baked skills, and average talents. This has led to my desire for a passion project in something I love. A passion project that I can spend years working on, crafting facet after facet with love and care, all-while honing my skills and becoming an expert in that craft. Which has led me to where I am now.

## Why Game Development?

Born in 1998, I grew up during the golden age of accessible gaming. While my friends and I spent countless nights on Xbox 360 attempting 360 no-scopes in Modern Warfare 2 until the early morning hours, there was one game that truly consumed our lives: **RuneScape**.

RuneScape wasn't just a gameâ€”it was a virtual world where we could become anyone we wanted. We spent countless hours grinding skills, completing quests, and building our characters. The game's progression system was brilliantly addictive: every level gained felt like a genuine achievement, every rare drop was cause for celebration, and the social aspect of playing alongside friends made it even more compelling.

What fascinated me most about RuneScape was how it created such an engaging experience with relatively simple mechanics. The graphics weren't cutting-edge, but the game had something far more valuableâ€”depth, meaningful progression, and a living world that felt worth inhabiting. This sparked my initial curiosity about game development and what makes certain games so captivating.

This curiosity led me to discover **RuneScape Private Servers (RSPS)**â€”custom forks of the original game featuring accelerated experience rates and unique content like custom weapons, bosses, and donation-based items. I was obsessed with these servers, partly because my limited screen time meant I could never truly excel at the original RuneScape.

Eventually, I decided to create my own server. There was just one problem: I knew absolutely nothing about game development or programming. Like any determined 14-year-old, I started downloading random server files and attempting to modify them. After acquiring 10 viruses and reformatting my computer 4 times, I realized I needed to actually learn how to code. I found a Java tutorial series on YouTube and dove headfirst into programming.

**RuneScape sparked my love for software development.** Thirteen years later, that childhood fascination has become my career. As a promise to my younger selfâ€”and armed with a degree in Computational Physicsâ€”I've decided it's finally time to create my own game. Building a physics engine has always been a goal of mine, and now I have the skills to make it happen.

**TL;DR:** I tried to recreate RuneScape as a kid, earned a Computational Physics degree in college, and now I'm a software engineer who still believes games have the power to inspire and teach.

## The Plan

## The Plan (Outline)

1. **Learn Essential Tools**
    - Master 3D modeling and animation in Blender
    - Explore Godot and Unreal Engine by building small projects

2. **Evaluate Game Engines**
    - Compare workflows and strengths of Godot vs Unreal
    - Decide whether to use an existing engine or build a custom one

3. **Develop the Game**
    - Begin building a fully-featured MMORPG inspired by RuneScape and World of Warcraft
    - Focus on persistent online worlds, progression systems, and community features

4. **Document and Share**
    - Share progress, experiments, and lessons learned throughout the journey

My plan is to start by learning the essential tools for modern game development. First, I'll dive into **Blender** to master 3D modeling and animation, which will be crucial for creating assets and environments. Next, I'll explore both **Godot** and **Unreal Engine**â€”two powerful game engines with very different workflows and strengths. By building small projects in each, I'll get a feel for their capabilities and decide which best fits my vision.

After gaining experience with Godot and Unreal, I'll make a key decision: either continue building my game in one of these engines or take on the ambitious challenge of developing my own custom game engine from scratch. This will depend on how well the existing engines support my goals and how much I want to push my technical skills.

The ultimate goal is to create a fully-featured **MMORPG** inspired by classics like **RuneScape** and **World of Warcraft**â€”a persistent online world with deep progression, engaging mechanics, and a vibrant community. This journey will be about learning, experimenting, and sharing every step along the way.

## What to Expect

This blog series will be a mix of:

- **Technical tutorials** - Code snippets, solutions to problems I encounter
- **Learning reflections** - What worked, what didn't, and lessons learned
- **Project updates** - Regular updates on the games I'm building
- **Resource recommendations** - Courses, books, and tools that help along the way

## My First Project
For my first project, Iâ€™m building a simple 2D physics-based puzzle gameâ€”a direct fusion of my computational physics background and my passion for game development. Inspired by the engaging progression systems of games like RuneScape, this project will focus on creating puzzles that gradually increase in complexity, encouraging experimentation and learning.

Key features will include:

- Realistic physics simulations powered by custom code and engine tools
- A progression system that rewards creative problem-solving
- Minimalist, intuitive design for a clean user experience
- Satisfying visual feedback, including particle effects and smooth animations
- Learning vector art for crisp, scalable game assets
- Mastering 2D modeling in Blender to create unique puzzle elements
- Exploring 3D modeling in Blender for future game expansion
- Developing animation skills to bring characters and environments to life

This project is my sandbox for mastering essential game dev skills, from asset creation in Blender to scripting gameplay mechanics in Godot or Unreal. Iâ€™ll document every step, sharing code snippets, design decisions, and lessons learned as I go.

## Join the Journey

Whether you're also new to game development or a seasoned developer, I'd love to have you follow along! I'll be sharing both my successes and my failures, because I believe the learning process is just as valuable as the end result.

Feel free to reach out with suggestions, questions, or just to share your own game development journey. You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/heisenbergs-uncertainty) or through the contact form on this site.

Next up: Setting up my development environment and creating my first "Hello World" game in Unity.

Stay tuned! ðŸŽ®
